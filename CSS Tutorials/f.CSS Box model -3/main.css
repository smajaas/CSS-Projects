/*
OUTLINE - outline property is a line that is drawn outside of the borders to make elements stand out.

OFFSET - what offset allow us to do is essentially move our outline.And the way it's going to look like if we're going to go with outline offset and then we can go negative or positive, if we're going to go positive value, then the outline is going to be more to the outside.if we give outline is 10 pixels it will be away from the edge of our element.

Essentially, if we go negative and if we're going to go with negative value, then the offset one is
going to be on the inside.
